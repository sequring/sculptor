## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/issues/new). Be sure to include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   The version of Chameleon you are using (commit hash or release tag).
*   A detailed description of the issue.
*   Steps to reproduce the bug.
*   What you expected to happen.
*   What actually happened (include error messages, logs, or screenshots if applicable).
*   Your operating system and Go version.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one:

1.  Check the [Issues](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/issues) to see if there's a similar suggestion already.
2.  If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/issues/new) to discuss your idea. Provide as much context and detail as possible.
    *   Explain the problem you're trying to solve or the use case for the enhancement.
    *   Describe your proposed solution.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Chameleon? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/sequring/chameleon/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

When you're ready to contribute code:

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/chameleon.git`
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b name-of-your-feature-or-fix`
4.  **Make your changes.** Adhere to the [Styleguides](#styleguides).
5.  **Add tests** for your changes. See [Testing](#testing).
6.  **Ensure all tests pass.**
7.  **Commit your changes** with a descriptive commit message (see [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages)).
8.  **Push your branch** to your fork: `git push origin name-of-your-feature-or-fix`
9.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` (or `develop`) branch of `sequring/chameleon`.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    *   Link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments if requested by maintainers.

## Development Setup

1.  Go version [e.g., 1.21] or higher.
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Dependencies are managed by Go modules. Run `go mod tidy` if needed.
4.  To run the application locally: `go run ./main.go -config config.yml` (assuming you have a `config.yml`).

## Styleguides

### Go Code

*   Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt` or `goimports`). Most editors do this automatically.
*   Write clear, understandable code with comments where necessary.
*   Follow Go best practices (e.g., effective error handling).
*   Try to adhere to the existing code style within the project.

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
*   Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more structured commit messages, e.g.:
    *   `feat: Add new proxy routing strategy`
    *   `fix: Correct handling of empty user tags`
    *   `docs: Update README with new API endpoint`
    *   `refactor: Simplify health check logic`

## Testing

*   Please write unit tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
*   Place tests in `_test.go` files in the same package as the code they are testing.
*   Run tests with: `go test ./...`
*   Ensure your changes don't break existing tests.


We look forward to your contributions!
